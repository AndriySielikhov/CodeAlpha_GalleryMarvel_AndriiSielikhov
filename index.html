                    <p>Doctor Stephen Strange was a brilliant and wealthy neurosurgeon, but after a car accident left his hands severely damaged, he turned to mysticism and the magical arts. After seeking out the Ancient One, he became the Sorcerer Supreme, protecting the Earth from magical and otherworldly threats.</p>
                    <p>Known for his sharp mind and determination, Doctor Strange possesses incredible magical abilities, including spellcasting, energy manipulation, and the ability to manipulate time through the Eye of Agamotto.

                    <p>Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, is a genius inventor, billionaire, and philanthropist. After being kidnapped by terrorists, Stark used his intellect to build a suit of armor and escape, marking the beginning of his journey as a hero. He later improved the suit, turning it into a high-tech weapon for good.</p>
                    <p>Stark's personality is a mix of charisma, confidence, and arrogance.

                    <p>As Black Panther, T’Challa possesses enhanced strength, agility, and senses due to the Heart-Shaped Herb, a mystical plant that grants him the powers of the Black Panther. He also wears a suit made of Vibranium, the strongest metal in the world, which gives him near invulnerability in combat.</p>
                    <p>Black Panther’s leadership is defined by his wisdom, courage, and sense of duty. He often faces difficult decisions, especially when it comes to protecting his people while engaging with the outside world.
